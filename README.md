# A Collection of Interview Questions & Solutions, in Ruby and C++

## Various questions and answers for interview coding challenges.

This repo contains a collection of interview questions and challenges implemented in ruby and C/C++.

There are two subfolders â€” `cpp/` and `ruby/`. 

They are completely independent, but a top-level build script called `/.travis.sh` contains the steps to run the ruby test suite, as well as the C/C++ sweet as well.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kigster/algorithmic-exercises 
cd algorithmic-exercises
```

And then, you can run `./.travis.sh`:


<a href="doc/test-suite.png" target="_blank" style="text-align: center; width: 100%; display: block; padding: 20px;" ><img src="doc/test-suite.png" width="60%" border="1" style="box-shadow: 0 0 25px black; "></a>

View the contents of that shell script for specifics on building each portion of the repo.
