# A Collection of Interview Questions & Solutions, in Ruby and C++

## Various questions and answers for interview coding challenges.

This gem contains a collection of interview questions and challenges implemented in ruby.

## Installation

There are two subfolders â€” `cpp/` and `ruby/`. 

They are completely independent, but a top-level build script called `/.travis.sh` contains the steps to run the ruby test suite, as well as the C/C++ sweet as well.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kigster/interview-questions 
cd interview-questions
./.travis.sh
```

View the contents of that shell script for specifics on building each portion of the repo.
