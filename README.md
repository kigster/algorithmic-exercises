# A Collection of Interview Questions & Solutions, in Ruby and C++

## Various questions and answers for interview coding challenges.

This repo contains a collection of interview questions and challenges implemented in ruby and C/C++.

There are two subfolders â€” `cpp/` and `ruby/`. 

They are completely independent, but a bash scripts inside the `bash` contain the steps necessary to run the ruby test suite, as well as the C/C++ as well.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kigster/algorithmic-exercises 
cd algorithmic-exercises
./build.sh
```

View the contents of the build shell script for specifics on building each portion of the repo.

You can also run each build separately:

```bash
cd algorithmic-exercises

# load the bash functions from "./bash/*"
source .bash_init

# run functions to build specific portions:
build::cpp

# or
build::ruby

```
